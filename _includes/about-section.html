         <p class="font-secondary paragraph-lg text-dark">Hello! Iâ€™m Abby, a writer, composer, artist, & erstwhile coder.</p>
        <p class="font-secondary paragraph-lg text-dark">
         During my computer science degree, I whiled away my breaks by writing my first science fiction story. Then, in 2017, I changed my major to creative writing. My CW 100 scifi story was eventually published in Clarkesworld in October 2024, after many revisions, 7 years later.   
          I also wrote poetry<span class='footnote' data-toggle="tooltip" 
          title="mostly confessional"></span>and nonfiction.</p>

          I'd also played piano for as long as I could remember. The pandemic hit and I started composing my own songs, now with string instruments.
