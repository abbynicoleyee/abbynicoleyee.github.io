          In my last life I did physics. Some time in 2017 I sat down in lab and, instead of aligning the laser,
          wrote a story. A few months later I published a sci-fi story, instead of a paper, in Nature.
          Then I started writing poetry, too, and it's all downhill<span class='footnote' data-toggle="tooltip"
          title="In the way a stone rolls down, and cannot stop."></span> from there.</p>
        <p class="font-secondary paragraph-lg text-dark">
          I like writing about women and sharp things, and I put them in my poetry<span class='footnote' data-toggle="tooltip"
          title="+1 short story"></span> collection,
          <a href="http://www.aqueductpress.com/books/978-1-61976-189-6.php">Goddess Bandit of the Thousand Hands</a>.
          I like my late-night second thoughts and illusions, optical or otherwise, like my prose
          chapbook, <a href="https://radixmedia.org/product/hard-mother-by-hal-y-zhang/">
          Hard Mother, Spider Mother, Soft Mother</a>. And sometimes I close my eyes and try to remember
          what it was like to not know English, and I put those thoughts into the poems in <a href="">AMNESIA</a>.

        <p class="font-secondary paragraph-lg text-dark">
          I hope you'll stay a while and look around.
