         <p class="font-secondary paragraph-lg text-dark">Hello! Iâ€™m Abby, a writer, composer, & occasional artist and coder.</p>
        <p class="font-secondary paragraph-lg text-dark">
         During my computer science degree, I whiled away my breaks by writing my first science fiction story. Then, in 2017, I changed my major to creative writing. My CW 100 scifi story was eventually published in <a href="highlights/#clarkesworld">Clarkesworld</a> in October 2024, after many revisions, 7 years later.   
        <p class="font-secondary paragraph-lg text-dark">
          I'd also played piano for as long as I could remember. In 2019, the pandemic hit and I started composing my own songs, now with string instruments.
