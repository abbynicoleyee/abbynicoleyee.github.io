<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v546/n7660/full/546696a.html" target="_blank">Read the story first!</a></p>

<p>Written April 8, 2017</p>

<p>I wrote <em>JJJ</em> in an hour when I was supposed to be doing actual work. It’s also my first accepted story, which is something you remember extra fondly forever. 10/10 would do again.</p>

<p>Back in March 2017, when I started to write again, the first story I actually finished was about the neural networks movie industry (currently still in the process of being rejected many times). Some days afterwards I thought of a dialogue, where an obsolete actor tells an aspiring one what happened, and the story wrote itself from there.</p>

<p>About the ordering of fields in the story: I think it’s much harder for a neural net to make a good plot than good art/music. Art and music (and poetry to some extent) are a lot more…holistic, for lack of a better word. If you have some weird pixels/chords/words it will still look/sound good overall. But with (non-experimental) prose, every sentence has to make sense, and they have to make sense all together. The same neural nets that can make very nice Van Gogh filters right now can only make garbage text, which is why I didn’t have the text AIs make original new stories, only do a stylistic fusion, which I think is doable soon (if not already). Making new music from composers is already in progress, although the pieces don’t pass the Turing Test (<a href="http://www.flow-machines.com/deepbach-polyphonic-music-generation-bach-chorales/" target="_blank">Bach Test?</a>) to any serious music fan, I think they can certainly fool non-music listeners.</p>

<p>The only hard part of writing <em>JJJ</em> was coming up with a title. Then I thought of Spielberg movies: I would totally watch Indiana Jones shoot Jaws while punching a T-Rex in the face. Get on it, computer scientists.</p>
