I enjoy thinking about my next meal and half-following the rules. My Erd&#337;s number is at most 4. Here is a bio you can use for publicity purposes:

Hal Y. Zhang writes science, fiction, and science fiction, in no particular order. Her language-and-loss chapbook _AMNESIA_ is published by Newfound, and her women-with-sharp-things collection _Goddess Bandit of the Thousand Arms_ is published by Aqueduct Press. She is online at [halyzhang.com](halyzhang.com) and [@halyzhang](https://twitter.com/halyzhang).

Here are some things I do in addition to staring off into space:

- Panelist, Newfound Anzald√∫a Poetry Prize, 2020
- Editorial Staff, Reckoning, 2020-now
- First Reader, sub-Q, 2019-2020

You can contact me directly at [first name]@halyzhang.com, or use the form below:
