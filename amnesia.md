What people said:

"this is chinese, pictographic only for the free trial," asserts Hal Y. Zhang's opening poem, setting up an unfolding of "radical loss." Just as a shadow life trails immigrants and their children through their days, the shadow language of Chinese animates many of these incisive English lines. Spare and visual, Zhang's poems capture the longings and misunderstandings that come with migration, as well as "what we gain in translation." *AMNESIA* is a powerful distillation of complex experience into the fewest possible words. ---Adrienne Su, author of *Middle Kingdom* and *Peach State*
