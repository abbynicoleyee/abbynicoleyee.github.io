<p class="paragraph-lg">I was born on a Thursday in October 1997. I write about weird and questionable people and ideas. I began writing at the age of 8, began drawing at 15, learned to code at 16, and started writing music at 23. </p> 
<p class="paragraph-lg">I studied the piano from the age of 9, placing 1st in competitions such as the Junior Student Convention and the National Student Convention. At 13, I competed in Accelerated Christian Education's International Student Convention held at James Madison University, Virginia in 2011 and won 2nd place. </p>

<p class="paragraph-lg">I'm currently based in Cagayan de Oro, Philippines.</p>
