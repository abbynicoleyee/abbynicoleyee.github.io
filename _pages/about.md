<p class="paragraph-lg">I enjoy thinking about my next meal and half-following the rules. My Erd&#337;s number is 4. Here is a bio you can use for publicity purposes:</p>

Hal Y. Zhang writes science, fiction, and science fiction, in no particular order. Her language-and-loss chapbook _AMNESIA_ was published by Newfound and won the Eric Hoffer Micro Press Award, and her women-with-sharp-things collection _Goddess Bandit of the Thousand Arms_ was published by Aqueduct Press. She is online at [halyzhang.com](https://halyzhang.com).
