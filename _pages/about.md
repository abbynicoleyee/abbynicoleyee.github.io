<p class="paragraph-lg">I enjoy thinking about my next meal and half-following the rules. My Erd&#337;s number is 4. Here is a bio you can use for publicity purposes:</p>

Hal Y. Zhang writes science, fiction, and science fiction, in no particular order. Her language-and-loss chapbook _AMNESIA_ was published by Newfound and won the Eric Hoffer Micro Press Award, and her women-with-sharp-things collection _Goddess Bandit of the Thousand Arms_ was published by Aqueduct Press. She is online at [halyzhang.com](https://halyzhang.com).

Here are some other things I've done in between bouts of staring off into space:

- <p>Guest Editor, Spring 2022 issue of Fireside Magazine</p>
- <p>Panelist, Newfound Anzald√∫a Poetry Prize, 2020</p>
- <p>Editorial Staff, Reckoning, 2020-2021</p>
- <p>First Reader, sub-Q, 2019-2020</p>
